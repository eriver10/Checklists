     So far our class has not discussed Overrides. It is my understanding that this function is inherited from its class, that is a rule set by the class it requires it to exist as perhaps a default. Then is up to the programmer to override or to specify what the function does in their new object.

    /*
     What's notable about these functions is that they carry more than one parameter or inputs if you will. And they are functions that return a value, or output.

     I am  unfamiliar with this syntax using the colon. I am fairly new to programming. It may suggest something along the lines of get this from this and be this variable. Then the inside mechanics of the function manipulate those values and send out, return that is, a value. In this case it most likely returns a single row?

    /*Note to self:
    
     func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView,
       numberOfRowsInSection section: Int
    
     is comparable to the following in other languages:
     
    Int numberOfRowsInSection(UITableView tableView, Int section) {
     
     
    Quote from book:
     
     "The _ underscore is used when you donâ€™t want a parameter to have an external name.
     
     ...the _ on the first parameter of methods that come from Objective-C frameworks. With such methods the first parameter only has one name but the other parameters have two.
     
     Sometimes people with experience in other languages get confused because they think that ChecklistViewController.swift contains three functions that are all named tableView().
     
     ...in Swift: the names of the parameters are part of the full method name."
     
     For example,
     
     "tableView(_:numberOfRowsInSection:)
     tableView(_:cellForRowAt:)
     tableView(_:didSelectRowAt:),"
     
     these are three different names.
