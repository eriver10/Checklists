/*
 It's important to note that the book states that the terms property and instance variable are interchangeable (in Swift but not objective-c). And, that both to refer to an object’s data items.
 Quoting directly it says:
    
 "In Swift terminology, a property is a variable or constant that is used in the context of an object. That’s exactly what an instance variable is."
 
 This answers my earlier question on instance variables.
